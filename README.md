Force.com Toolkit for PHP
=========================

EDIT
----

This fork is intended to make the Force.com Toolkit for PHP in packagist and will be used in my project to its classes and facilities available to be used in a Laravel 4 port.

The changes made by me (Paul Dzenisevich) are minor and won't change the core classes functionality, just make it available to be loaded by [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

Once the main project by [developerforce](https://gitub.com/developerforce/) is available though composer, this fork can be dropped and replaced by the original.

Force.com Toolkit for PHP
=========================

The Force.com PHP Toolkit provides an easy-to-use wrapper for the Force.com Web Services SOAP API, presenting SOAP client implementations for both the enterprise and partner WSDLs.

See the [getting started guide](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_Toolkit_for_PHP) for sample code to create, retrieve, update and delete records in the Force.com database.
